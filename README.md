# Project Title

Personal project to make a bandwidth analyzer. The final product should automatically run speed tests (intervals that user sets) and create a graph of the results. The graph settings should also be set by the user.


## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - The language
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - data structures
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - graphing


## Authors

* **Jeff Lynn**  - [jeffrlynn](https://github.com/jeffrlynn)


## TO DO

[x] Y axis automatically adjusts to data input

[ ] User interface to choose which data is used in plot

[ ] Automatically run the speed test and plot

* Can be done with task scheduler

* Would be better if this whole program could be installed and run periodically

[x] Image of plot does not open properly
